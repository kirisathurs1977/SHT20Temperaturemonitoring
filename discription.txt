The SHT20 humidity and temperature sensor of Sensirion has become an industry standard in terms of form factor and intelligence: 
Embedded in a reflow solderable Dual Flat No leads (DFN) package of 3 x 3mm foot print and 1.1mm height it provides calibrated, linearized sensor signals in digital, 
I2C format.Every sensor is individually calibrated and tested. Lot identification is printed on the sensor and an electronic identification code is stored on the chip â€“ 
which can be read out by command. Furthermore, the resolution of SHT2 can be changed by command (8/12bit up to 12/14bit for RH/T) and a checksum helps to improve communication 
reliability.
